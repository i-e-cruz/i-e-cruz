### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isela Cruz. I graduated from CSULB with a Bachelor's in computer science in May 2023.

My hobbies include playing games, dancing, painting, collecting manga, and watching anime.

I am currently not working on any project.

I am currently looking for an internship opportunity. I want to apply the skills acquired from my coursework into a company that will expand my knowledge with hands-on experience.
