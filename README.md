### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isela Cruz. I am currently a fourth year at CSULB studying computer science. I love playing video games so much that I went into this major with becoming a video game developer in mind.

My hobbies include playing games (duh), dancing, painting, collecting manga, and watching anime.

I am currently not working on any project but I plan on making my own game during the summer.

I am currently looking for an internship opportunity. I want to apply the skills acquired from my coursework into a company that will expand my knowledge with hands-on experience.
